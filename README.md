**Commodo is a library for running NodeJS code in the browser.**

## Usage

Commodo only aims to be compliant with WebKit. If you want to be compatible with ghetto old browsers, use [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) and [es5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim).
Using Commodo is as simple as including commodo.min.js on your web page. Please not that Commodo is a newborn baby and only supports certain NodeJS functionality.
